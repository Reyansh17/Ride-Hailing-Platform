# Decentralized Ride Hailing Platform
## Introduction
Overall, our platform aims to achieve the following objectives:
- Building a decentralized system that enables people to book rides and make payments through cryptocurrency (DRHP Token)
- Create an ERC-20 token  which can be used by passengers to book rides in the platform as our primary currency
- Allow users to stake their DRHP tokens and earn interest which will be accomplished through a lending pool
- Implement on-chain governance which allows the community  to make important business decisions based on their share of DRHP tokens
- Building an overall web application that enables users to book rides in a decentralized manner and handle all the operations involved in ride booking.

## Proposed Work
- The proposed work for our project will involve development of a complete web platform that will carry out decentralized ride booking using smart contracts.
- The decentralized aspect of the project will be carried out using the PoS blockchain Polygon
- Creation of ERC-20 token DRHP to carry out all the operations in our platform
- Staking mechanism of ERC-20 to enable the users to earn interest by staking their DRHP tokens through our protocol. 
- Driver incentivization using ERC-721 tokens (NFTs) to unlock potential revenue sharing from the company. 
- On-chain governance to enable the community to submit proposals and govern our project through various business decisions.
