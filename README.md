# Decentralized Ride Hailing Platform
## Introduction
Overall, our platform aims to achieve the following objectives:
- Building a decentralized system that enables people to book rides and make payments through cryptocurrency (DRHP Token)
- Create an ERC-20 token  which can be used by passengers to book rides in the platform as our primary currency
- Allow users to stake their DRHP tokens and earn interest which will be accomplished through a lending pool
- Implement on-chain governance which allows the community  to make important business decisions based on their share of DRHP tokens
- Building an overall web application that enables users to book rides in a decentralized manner and handle all the operations involved in ride booking.
